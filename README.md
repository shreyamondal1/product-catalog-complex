## Code Explanation

### Data Management
- Product data is embedded directly in the JavaScript as a JSON object
- The application maintains two arrays: `allProducts` (original data) and `filteredProducts` (current view)

### Search Functionality
- The search input listens for `input` events
- Filters products using case-insensitive string matching on product names
- Updates the display in real-time

### Sorting Logic
- Three sort options implemented using JavaScript's `sort()` method
- Price sorting uses numerical comparison
- Name sorting uses `localeCompare()` for proper alphabetical ordering
- Sorting is applied after filtering to maintain search results

### Display Updates
- The `updateDisplay()` function handles all UI updates
- Uses document fragments for efficient DOM manipulation
- Implements staggered animations for product cards
- Shows "No Results" message when appropriate

### Security
- Implements HTML escaping to prevent XSS attacks
- Uses `textContent` for user-generated content

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with flexbox, grid, gradients, and animations
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: CSS framework for responsive design and utilities
- **Bootstrap Icons 1.10.0**: Icon library for visual elements
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure ES6+ JavaScript for functionality
